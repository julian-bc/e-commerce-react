# E-commerce with React, TailwindCSS & Deno 🛒
## About
E-commerce built with React: A simple web application utilizing FakeStore API for mock data integration. This project was created as a learning experience. Any feedback or suggestions for improvement are welcome! 🎉

This is my first React application, where I learned fundamental concepts such as:

- ⚛️ Basic React concepts: Understanding JSX, props, and hooks.
- 🔗 useState: Managing component state.
- 🔄 useEffect: Handling side effects.
- 📌 React Router DOM: Navigating between pages.
- 📂 useContext: Managing global state.
- 📦 Component creation: Structuring a modular UI.
- 🔌 API calls: Fetching and displaying data.
- 🦕 Deno: Using it as a package manager.
